Profiles created by Rick for coffee roasting
Radio broadcaster turned Pastor, turned social entrepeneur, turned missionary, turned coffee roaster.  My actual role today is helping neighbourhoods flourish.
The journey is much like roasting coffee; the elements of heat, time and air flow seem simple but are revolutionary in terms of when and how they are applied to bean development.
